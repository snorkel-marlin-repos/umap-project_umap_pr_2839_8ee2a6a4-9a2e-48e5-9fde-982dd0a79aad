**How to report a bug**

We, developers, need to REPRODUCE a bug to be able to fix it. So if you want the bug to be fixed, help us REPRODUCE it.

We need:
- A link to a map (**⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT! Your issue will probably be ignored without that link**, if your map is private, create a new one with minimal data to REPRODUCE)
- detailed steps to REPRODUCE on this map
- whatever other detail will help us understand and REPRODUCE (browser details, screenshot…)
